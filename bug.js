This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK. The error message might vary but generally indicates a problem with the Android build process, such as missing dependencies or incorrect configurations within your project.  A common symptom is a build failure with no clear indication of the root cause.  This often happens when there's a mismatch between the versions of dependencies used in your project and those expected by the Expo build system. Another possibility is a conflict or issue with custom native modules.
