To solve this, carefully examine your `package.json` dependencies. Ensure that all packages are compatible with each other and the current Expo SDK version.  Check for conflicts using tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why`. If you're using custom native modules, ensure they're correctly configured and integrated. Cleaning your project (using `expo prebuild --clean` or similar) and rebuilding might also resolve temporary issues. For more stubborn problems, consider creating a minimal reproducible example to isolate the root cause.  Check the Expo documentation and community forums for similar issues.
