# Unclear Expo CLI Android Build Errors

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The problem is characterized by cryptic error messages that provide little guidance on resolving the build failure.  This often arises from dependency conflicts or issues within native modules.  The `bug.js` file shows a simplified example of a project setup that might lead to this error, while `bugSolution.js` offers potential solutions.
